    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bluecolab/BlueColab_MobileDataViz.git
    ```

    ```
4. Install the dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

## Running locally on computer via Expo Go

1. If you haven't. start a device emulator on your computer. The instructions to start one can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-emulator#2).
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Make sure you are in the aquawatch_mobile_app directory.
4. In the terminal start the app by running:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
5. On the terminal, there will be instructions to start the app in emulator. (For example, pressing A key should start the app in an Android emulator)
    1. If it's your first time running the app, it may prompt you to install Expo. Hit yes if it does.

## Running on mobile device via Expo Go

1. Make sure your computer and phone are on the _same_ WiFi network.
2. Make sure you have 'Expo Go' App downloaded on your phone.
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Make sure you are in the aquawatch_mobile_app directory.
5. In the terminal start the app by running:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    5a. If you aren't able to connect to same network try (if it fails try again):
    ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
    ```
6. After running the above, a QR code should pop up.
    1. iPhone: Open the Camera App on iPhone, then scan the QR Code.
    2. Android: Open the Expo Go app, hit "Scan QR Code", then scan the QR Code.
7. The Expo Go app should open - with our app loaded!

## Running a Development Build

This is higher-level testing but overcomes limitations of Expo Go.

1. Create a new branch of any name - do not push it to GitHub
2. Please follow: https://expo.dev/blog/expo-go-vs-development-builds#how-to-get-started-with-a-development-build
3. Once setup you can run:

```
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not push any EAS related files to GitHub, especially to `main`. Doing so causes others to need your credentials when running `npx expo start`.

## File structure

### High level overview:

We use [file-based navigation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/basics/core-concepts/) provided via the [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for navigation.

Please follow this structure when creating new files:

```
aquawatch_mobile_app - Parent folder, for all sob-directories and config files
├───app - For all app pages and navigation related files
│   └───(tabs) - Our main navigation pattern, all pages should be under this directory
├───assets - For all images, icons, and fonts
├───components - For all of the custom components (building blocks of pages)
├───contexts - For all of the custom contexts (a way to share data between all pages and components)
├───hooks - For all of the custom hooks (reusable logic for state, data fetching, etc.)
├───patches - For patches needed to fix broken npm packages
└───types - For all custom TypeScript type definitions
```

Each of the above directories may be organized even further, grouped by similar functionality.
