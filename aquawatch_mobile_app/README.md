## Getting Started
1. Install all the above prerequisites. Instructions on how are linked above.
2. Open a terminal in this directory ``../BlueColab_MobileDataViz/aquawatch_mobile_app/``
3. Run ``npm i``, it installs all needed node_packages and expo. It may take a few minutes to install everything.

## Running locally on computer
1. Start a device emulator on your computer.
2. Run ``npx expo start`` (should be installed with node) in terminal window. Expo should be installed when you do ``npm i``.
3. On the terminal, there will be instructions to start the app in emulator. (For example, pressing A key should start the app in an Android emulator)

## Running locally on mobile device
1. Run ``npx expo start`` (should be installed with node) in terminal window. Expo should be installed when you do ``npm i``.
2. After running the above, a QR code should pop up. Make sure your computer and phone are on the same WiFi network. Scan the QR Code that pops up with your phone.
3. The Expo Go app should open - with our app loaded! The first time running the app takes loading time.
