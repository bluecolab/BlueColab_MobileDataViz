                    Chances are the water you use is safe, but millions have unfortunately found
                    otherwise. In a matter of hours, a single sip of pathogen-contaminated water can
                    result in serious illness. Currently, labs require 24–48 hours to report
                    analyses of samples taken weekly, or less.
